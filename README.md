<!-- # Personalized Customer Offer Recommendation System

## Overview
This project simulates a data-driven personalized offer recommendation system, combining data engineering, machine learning, uplift modeling, and ROI simulation to optimize customer engagement and incremental revenue.

## Features
- Synthetic dataset of 100k customers, transactions, offers, and redemptions
- Feature engineering: RFM, behavioral metrics, and offer redemption history
- Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
- Predictive modeling with Random Forest to estimate offer redemption probability
- Two-model uplift approach to identify incremental buyers
- ROI simulation for campaigns
- Interactive dashboard with Streamlit

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Streamlit for dashboard
- SQL (PostgreSQL/SQLite) for data extraction

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/personalized-offers-project.git

## **Step 6: Make it Resume-Friendly**

- Add **screenshots** of dashboard / charts in `README.md`  
- Include **sample numbers** (like ROI, uplift, segment insights)  
- Link GitHub repo in your resume under **Projects**  

Example resume line:

> **Personalized Customer Offer Recommendation System** â€“ Built a data-driven system using Python & ML to segment customers, predict offer redemption, and simulate ROI; achieved 152% simulated campaign ROI.

If you want, I can **write a fully finished GitHub-ready version** with:  

- **Optimized vectorized dataset generation**  
- **Jupyter notebook skeleton with code**  
- **Streamlit dashboard code**  
- **README.md fully formatted**  

So you can literally **upload everything to GitHub in one go**.  

Do you want me to do that? -->
